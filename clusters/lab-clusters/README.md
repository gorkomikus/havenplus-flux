# Lab Clusters

This directory holds Flux clusters configuration used by the HavenPlus team for lab and demonstration purposes. These configurations represent active cluster instances across various cloud providers. 
  
With this new lay-out, we'll be able to:
- support multiple clusters per provider for e.g. internal testing
    purposes
- prevent config duplication as a lab-cluster is just another overlay
    for the more "generic" provider overlay, e.g. cyso
- circumvent the complixity of using forks
